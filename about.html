      <h2> <b>About </b></h2>
    </center>
<p>
    My small web based game is built purely on JavaScript and HTML5,
    with this game I have tried to create a platform based game. Much
    like Mario or in some ways Manic miner. The main aim of the game is
    to collect the most coins and set a high score.
</p>
<p>
  Before starting this game, I had basically no knowledge of Javascript
  and very basic skills in HTML/CSS but I believe over the past few
  weeks working on this game, I believe y skills have increased greatly
  and I am happy with the result of my game.
</p>
<p>
  Warning, on the final level (level 3) there is a possibility of losing
   coins by falling of the platform and into the water.
</p>

  <center> <h2><b> Features</b> </center> </h2>
<p>
  Some of the included features involve:
<br>
•	User control (keyboard input) <br>
•	Interactive sounds <br>
•	A scoring system <br>
•	Multiple levels <br>
</p>

<center><h2> <b> Images </b> </h2> </center>
<p>
  All images on my site, including the background, players, coins and
   treasure were created by myself using Abode Photoshop CS6.
</p>
<center><h2> <b> Sounds </b> </h2> </center>
<p>
  All sounds were downloaded legally from a site called freesound.org.
   All of which are .WAV files.
</p>
<center><h2> <b> Resource Used </b> </h2> </center>
<p>
  I used a very basic tutorial online for the basic layout of the
   platforms and the player. (This link will be provided at the bottom).
    From this small example I then went onto create lots of other
    functions which did various things from checking collisions to
    game_over. Other resources I used were W3C schools and
    Stackoverflow. These links will also be provided below.
</p>
<center><h2> <b> Future Requirements </b> </h2> </center>
<p>
  To develop my game further in the future I will create more like a
  manic miner type game, where there will be enemies involved, there
   would be a high score board for different uses to compete when
   being on my site and more levels. The main reason I did not
   accomplish these tasks is due to lack of time and Javascript
   based knowledge.
</p>
<center><h2> <b> Declaration of Originality </b> </h2> </center>
<p>
  I declare that the contents of this page are entirely my own work
  apart from the declared exceptions above (freesound, W3schools,
  stackoverflow and the basic tutorial). The images were created by
  myself, and the sounds are free to use as displayed on the site
  above.
